# Challenge 2 – Random Quote Generator 📜

This is the second project in my **Weekly Web Dev Challenge** series where I build small web apps using core web technologies to grow my skills and build in public.

## 🚀 About the Project

The **Random Quote Generator** is a minimalist web app that fetches and displays random quotes from a public API. With a click of a button, users get inspired by new quotes — perfect for learning how to work with APIs and dynamic data using JavaScript.

## 🔧 Features

- Fetches a random quote using an external API (JSON format)
- Displays the quote and author dynamically
- Clean, responsive UI
- Reloads a new quote on button click

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Fetch API**
- **JSON data parsing**
